      <h3>Plan</h3>
      <hr>
               <h4>Do you have a handle on who your users are? </h4>
        
        <ol>
          <li>The first step to improving the user experience of your site is to figure out who the users are (or who you want them to be). There are several ways to get information about the users of your site. You can <a href="https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/online-surveys.html">conduct online surveys</a>, <a href="http://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/focus-groups.html">focus groups</a>, <a href="http://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/contextual-interview.html">contextual interviews</a>, or <a href="http://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/individual-interviews.html">individual interviews</a>.</li>
            <li>Advanced topic: Consider creating Personas. Personas allow you to design for a few representative users, while meeting the needs of many. To learn more, start with this introduction on <a href="https://www.usability.gov/get-involved/blog/2005/09/audience-segmentation.html">audience segmentation</a>.</li>
              <li>If you are interested additional information, take a look at this more <a href="https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/personas.html">detailed explanation of personas</a>.</li>
              </ol>
        <br><br>
<h3>Analyze</h3>
<hr>
   <h4>Do you know the reasons why your audience is overlooking this content?  How do you know this is happening?</h4>
   <P>Did you confirm this problem through search analytics, page traffic, and user feedback? </P>
<ol>
  <li>Have you traced the path your users take?</li>

    <li>Many times great content is buried in a site and there is no easy way to get to it. If you have a <a href="https://www.digitalgov.gov/services/dap/incorporating-the-digital-analytics-program-tool-into-your-agencys-metric-program/">metrics program with clickstream analytics</a>, start by tracing the path that your users take to get to that content. Does it make sense? Is there a common theme? </li>
    </ol>
<br><br>
<h3>Design</h3>
<hr>
<h4> How are you presenting the content?  </h4>

<ol>
  <li>Did you optimize the page so your customers can find and navigate through your content?</li>
  <li>Has it been optimized for search indexing?  <a href="https://digital.gov/2013/05/31/four-steps-to-achieve-good-seo/">Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</a> is the practice of optimizing your web content so search engines find it and display it at the top of a user's search results. This could be a search engine like Google or Bing, or it could be the search engine on your own site. The better you optimize your pages, the more likely your users will find your content.</li>
  <li>Is it accessible through your Navigation?  Good Information Architecture (IA) will help your users find your content when they use your menu and navigation. Does it really make sense for your content to be under that particular heading or sub-heading? Maybe it would do better under two or even three of your headings? How do you choose the best one if you can only have one? Review the <a href="https://digital.gov/2014/07/02/using-top-tasks-to-be-top-notch-federal-reserve-board-usability-case-study/">case study on the Federal Reserve's top-task methodology</a> and pay particular attention to <em>Step 3: Card Sort</em> and Step 4: <em>First-click Testing</em>.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Can you tie it to other more popular in content? </h4>
<ol><li>
What related content on popular pages can you take advantage of?<br><br>
Related Content is also known as “if you like that you might like this”. If your content management system (CMS) enables you to tag your content then be sure to take advantage of it.  Tagging content means that you use predetermined keywords to identify what the content is about.  </li>
<li>
Typically, you tag the content at the "lowest level of specificity."  For example, if the content is about the port in Charleston, SC you would tag it as Charleston and perhaps South Carolina to clarify which state.  But you wouldn't also tag it United States or North America.  The CMS will ensure that any search for a port in South Carolina or in the U.S. returns Charleston as a result.<br><br>
The benefit of this type of tagging is that the CMS can also prompt the user to look at your less trafficked content by providing links to it from your most trafficked content.  If your Savannah, GA page receives an abundance of traffic, let your CMS prompt users to visit your Charleston, SC too.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Is all of your content linked to so both users and search engines can find it?</h4>
<ol>
<li>Do you have prominent links to your important content?</li>
<li>Good Linking helps your users find relevant content. If a particular piece of content is important, make sure you link to it from other relevant pages - especially the highly trafficked ones and especially if your CMS does not automatically link related content for you.</li>
<li>Keep in mind that your Site Map is the bare minimum for ensuring your content is linked to at least once. Make sure all of the content is accessible from the site map and organize it as your navigation or information architecture's hierarchy.  If applicable, submit your site map to the popular search engines to ensure they are indexing your site.</li>
