      <hr>
<h4>Are you familiar with usability testing?</h4>
<ol><li>If you are new to usability testing and have no budget, you need to do some reading to learn more about usability testing ;-)</li>
<li>For an overview of usability testing take a look at <a href=https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/usability-testing.html">this section</a> on Usability.gov. To run an <a href="http://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/running-usability-tests.html">effective usability test</a>, you need to develop a solid <a href=https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/planning-usability-testing.html">test plan</a>, <a href="https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/recruiting-usability-test-participants.html">recruit participants</a>, and then <a href="http://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/reporting-usability-test-results.html">analyze and report your findings</a>. For more detailed information on the testing process, scroll down to chapter 18 in these <a href="http://guidelines.usability.gov/">usability guidelines</a>.</li>
<li>Usability testing is just one part of the user centered design process. To get an overview of the whole process, look at this <a href="http://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/resources/ucd-map.html">User Centered Design Map</a> on Usability.gov </li>
</ol>
<h4>What is the goal of the testing? Might there be other types of user research that would better meet your needs? </h4>

<ol><li>If you are not sure what type of testing would best meet your goals, read about different types of <a href="http://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/user-research.html">user research techniques</a> at Usability.gov</li></ol>

<h3>Design</h3>

<h4>Are you looking for inexpensive ways to do usability testing? </h4>

<ol>
 <li> If you are looking for a step by step do it yourself guide to usability testing, consider Steve Krug's book <a href="http://www.sensible.com/rsme.html">Rocket Surgery Made Easy</a>. Per Steve, "Unlike other books about usability testing, Rocket Surgery also explains how to decide which problems to fix, and the kinds of changes you should make to fix them.<br />
(Hint: the smallest changes are often the best ones). </li>
</ol>

<h4> Do you need some standard tools and templates to use for your testing process?</h4>
<ol>
<li>If so, start with <a href="http://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/planning-usability-testing.html">this page on the usability.gov site</a>.</li>
<li>Remember, to <a href="http://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/running-usability-tests.html">run an effective usability test</a>, you need to develop a solid <a href="http://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/planning-usability-testing.html">test plan</a>, <a href="http://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/recruiting-usability-test-participants.html">recruit participants</a>, and then <a href="http://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/reporting-usability-test-results.html">analyze and report your findings</a>.</li>
</ol>

<h4> Do you have customers that have accessibility requirements? Even if you think you don't, you still need to comply with Section 508 standards. </h4>
<ol>
  <li>The Social Security Administration has a <a href=http://www.ssa.gov/accessibility/bpl/default.htm">Best Practices Library</a> to help you make your site 508 compliant. To learn more about 508 requirements in general, go to <a href="http://section508.gov">Section508.gov</a>.</li>
<li>As you find usability issues, make sure your solutions include 508 fixes as well. Retest your system against 508 guidelines after any updates or changes. </li>
<li>Remember: you're helping yourself by enabling your content to be more accessible by more customers across more channels.</li></ol>

<h4>Will you be testing to see if your website is compliant with the Plain Language Act? </h4>
<ol>
<li>The use of plain language on federal websites is the law. There are many resources available to you at the <a href="http://www.plainlanguage.gov/">plainlanguage.gov</a> website. The <a href=http://www.plainlanguage.gov/howto/quickreference/glance.cfm">Plain English At-a-glance</a> section is an excellent place to start.</li>
<li>The folks at 18F (US Digital Services) also have some excellent guidance on plain language in their <a href="https://pages.18f.gov/content-guide/">content guide</a>.</li></ol>

        <br><br>
<h3>Analyze</h3>
<hr>
<h4> Once you've conducted your usability test sessions, how do you plan to present your findings? </h4>
<ol><li>Reports of findings from usability testing sessions can take many different forms. </li>
<li>For simple testing, where all of the stakeholders have watched the testing sessions, you can simply compare your notes and discuss the findings.</li>
<li>For more formal reports, take a look at this <a href="http://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/resources/templates/report-template-usability-test-long.html">template</a> on the usability.gov site.</li>
