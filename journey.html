       <h3>Plan</h3>
      <hr>
               <h4>Do you have a handle on who your users are? </h4>
        
        <ol>
          <li>The first step to improving the user experience of your site is to figure out who the users are (or who you want them to be). There are several ways to get information about the users of your site. You can conduct online surveys, focus groups, contextual interviews, or individual interviews.<br><br><strong>Advanced topic</strong>: Consider creating Personas. Personas allow you to design for a few representative users, while meeting the needs of many. To learn more, start with this introduction on audience segmentation. If you are interested additional information, take a look at this more detailed explanation of personas.</li>
            </ol>
        <br><br>
<h3>Analyze</h3>
<hr>
  <h4>Verify that your users are ‘falling' off at that step. Are you getting that information from analytics, feedback, or help desk? </h4> 
<ol>
  <li>You should have a clear understanding of how your users move through your entire process not just the one troublesome step.
User Analytics -  The organization needs to learn from the users what thought processes were occurring that caused them to ‘fall off' off at that step. A strong place to start is by understanding and leveraging analytics: Read Usablity.gov's <a href="http://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/web-analytics.html ">What and Why of Web Analytics</a></li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Advance Topic</strong>: Check out the analytics section below to learn more about setting up and learning from your analytics.<br>
Check other data sources, like ACSI data for a federal website, for clues as to why this is happening. Look at DigitalGov.gov to learn about bounce rates and understand where users might leave your site.</li></ul>

<h4>Are all users falling off at that step or merely specific user types?Find out what processes users think are “easy” and why. Find out if there are other “hard” steps.</h4> 
<ol>
  <li>What is the decision point that leads them to stop finishing that step in the process?

    <li>Does the step in question deviate from the established process flow?
<li>There are several ways to get input from your users. First, familiarize yourself with the different types of user research by reading <a href="http://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/user-research.html">User Research Testing Basics</a>.

  <li>You could:
<ul>
  <li>conduct a <a href="http://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/usability-testing.html">basic usability test</a> on the specific workflow or process. You don't necessarily have to test your entire site. Focus on the one problem area and spend your time/resources there.</li>
<li>survey your users leveraging an online tool. If it's a government website, use the ACSI survey tool and ask how about that particular step in the process.
  <li>conduct <a href="http://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/focus-groups.html">focus groups</a> to understand overall how the organization's processes on their website are being viewed and what users think of the organization.  </li>
    <li>conduct some user research that includes a <a href="http://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/task-analysis.html">task analysis</a> component to figure out what was missing. </li></li>
</ul>
</ol>
<br><br>
<h3>Design</h3>
<hr>

<h4>Consider other factors including time to completion and total number of steps. How long are users typically spending in the workflow.
</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Perhaps users are falling off at a specific point because the entire process too time consuming. There may be multiple root causes for why the workflow breaks down at any given step.</li>
  <li>Consider revising the data entry tasks into more consumable/frictionless interactions in sequence and priority that supports the primary system goal.

  </ol>

<br><br>
<h3>Test & Refine</h3>
<hr>

<h4>Follow up to make sure changes implemented have resulted in users completing the process by looking at your analytics regularly. 
</h4>
<ul><li>Analytics: If you have not had much experience with web analytics on your .gov site, consider joining the <a href="http://www.digitalgov.gov/services/dap/">Digital Analytics Program</a> hosted by GSA. They'll help you apply the free analytics code to your pages, gather metrics, and learn how to read them.</li></ol>
