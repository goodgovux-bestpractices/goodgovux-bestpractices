<h3>Analyze</h3>
<hr>
<p>It depends on what the site is used for. If you are referring to your "corporate" site, meaning the website you use to describe your agency, its mission, how it's organized, who the senior leaders are, etc. then you may need to fully reassess the content, information architecture, and, ultimately, the goals of the site.  The good news is that you can take a more <a href="www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/resources/ucd-map.html">user-centered approach</a> to the redesign.  The key here is determining who your most important users are.</p>
<p>
If, however, your site is where you provide information and enable the public to complete tasks, you may not need to restructure your content.  Remember, your users care little about how your agency is organized.  They are more concerned about doing what they need to do.  Most likely your agency's core goals for the site have not changed much.  Accordingly, your content should continue to meet those goals (if not that's another issue).</p>

<p>Nevertheless, this is a good opportunity to do a content review.  Reassess your <a href="https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/content-strategy.html">content strategy</a> and <a href="https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/content-inventory.html">inventory your content</a> to ensure that the site does indeed meet the agency's goals, supports your users well, and is up to date.  Also, reassess how efficiently you support the site.  Take the time to confirm that you have the <a href="https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/project-team.html">right staff</a>, the right stakeholders, and the right processes in place to sustain the site indefinitely.</p>
