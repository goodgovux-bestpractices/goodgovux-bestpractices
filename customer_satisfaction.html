<h3>Analyze</h3>
<hr>
   <h4>Congratulations for paying attention to user feedback! Here are some questions to consider: </h4>
   <ul><li>What areas are most important to your customers and your process? </li>
<li>How are your scores for the dimensions that support UX? </li>
</ul>

<p>These are a good place to start. There might be some small projects you can complete quickly. Also, review the following consideration.</p>
<br><br>
<h3>Design</h3>
<hr>

<h4>How do you ensure that users quickly find what their looking for?</h4>

<p> Give users multiples paths to your content, especially the important content.</p>
<ol><li>First, organize the content logically by developing a strong information architecture.  Information architecture (IA) focuses on organizing, structuring, and labeling content in an effective and sustainable way.</li>
<li>Second, when providing large amounts of information, include a search engine on your site.  GSA provides a very powerful search engine that you can integrate into your site very quickly.  You'll then need to review your content to make sure the search engine indexes it well and returns the best pages when your us.</li>
<li>Finally, include a site map on your site.  If worse comes to worst, a user can always scour the site map to find the information they need.  This also helps external search engine like Google and Bing to index your site.</li>
</ol>

<h4>How do you ensure that users know what steps to take to accomplish what they need to do?</h4>
<ol>
<li>Just because you provide information and tools on your site doesn't mean that your users understand how to access and use it.  Review the tasks that your organization would like users to accomplish.  Also, review what your users have told you they want to accomplish.  You can learn this by engaging with your users through contextual interviews, focus groups, and online surveys, among many other tools.</li>
<li>Once you've created your list of tasks that the site should enable, create use cases for each task or set of tasks.  This will give you a firm understanding of what users are trying to do.  From there, reassess and improve how a user accomplishes those tasks by working through your site.  Do frequent and focused usability tests to ensure you are indeed making improvements.</li></ol>
<h4>How do you ensure that the site's information is understandable?</h4>
<ol><li>Government websites are notorious for containing jargon, acronyms, and verbose language that the average user has a tough time understanding.</li>
<li>Review and edit your content to include more plain language throughout.  You will see immediate benefits to your satisfaction scores if you make the content much easier to understand.  </li></ol>

<h4>How do you ensure that the site is as widely accessible as possible? </h4>
<ol><li>Don't assume that your customers are just using a web browser to access your site.  Many people use tools like screen readers and color contrast tools to augment their experience.  Ensure your site is 508 compliant by following Accessibility Basics that help make your content easier to consume.</li>
<li>Similarly, many of your customers use mobile devices to access your site, which presents unique usability issues.  Or they might start their task on your site with their browser, switch to their tablet, then finalize it on their phone.  There's a lot to consider when you take into account all of the different "channels" a customer might use.</li><li>One of the most popular solutions to the cross-channel problem is to make your site responsive.  Responsive design helps ensure that your site is presented in its optimal form and layout regardless of the device being used.  It's not the silver bullet for solving all usability problems across all devices, but it does address many of them.</li></ol>
